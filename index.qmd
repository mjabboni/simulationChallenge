# 🎲 Simulation Challenge - Starter Template

::: {.callout-important}
## 📋 What You Need To Do

- [ ] Fork and create repo `simulationChallenge` in your GitHub
- [ ] Clone locally and open in Cursor
- [ ] Write your analysis in this `index.qmd`
- [ ] Render to HTML (`quarto render` or Render button)
- [ ] Push HTML to your repo and enable GitHub Pages
- [ ] Share your site: `https://[your-username].github.io/simulationChallenge/`
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required
Use Cursor AI for speed, but ensure you understand and can explain the results in your own words.  Verify cursor's calculations as investment simulation is tricky.

## The Investment Game (Brief)

You have the opportunity to buy-in to this game next week with $30,000. Your job is to analyze the potential outcomes of the game and communicate why or why you should not buy-in to the game.  

Each year after buy-in you flip a fair coin:

- Heads: increase your account balance by 50%
- Tails: decrease your account balance by 40%

You play annually until age 75. Your mission is to analyze outcomes and communicate insights clearly.

### Generative DAG Model (from the source challenge)

The following DAFT diagram shows the generative structure of the investment game over time.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import daft

# Create the DAG directly without custom class
investmentDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=100, alternate_style="outer")

# Initial wealth (deterministic)
investmentDAG.add_node("W0", "Initial Wealth\n$W_0 = 30,000$", x=4, y=2.5, aspect=5.4, 
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Time t nodes  
investmentDAG.add_node("Ct", "Coin Flip t\n$C_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=0, y=1, aspect=4, scale = 1.6,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})
investmentDAG.add_node("Wt", "\nWealth t\n$W_t = 1.5 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 1$\n$W_t = 0.6 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 0$\n", x=4, y=1, scale = 1.6, aspect=4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edges showing the relationships
investmentDAG.add_edge("W0", "Wt")
investmentDAG.add_edge("Ct", "Wt")

# Add plate around time-dependent nodes
investmentDAG.add_plate([-2, 0.5, 7.8, 1.0], label="t = 1, ..., N", shift=-0.1)
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-investment-dag
#| fig-cap: Generative DAG model for the investment game showing how wealth evolves over time through coin flips
#| echo: false
investmentDAG.show()
```

## Analysis Tasks (Fill These In)

::: {.callout-note}
## Grading Scope

- Sections 1–4: required and can earn up to 90% of the grade.
- Sections 5–6: optional; strong, well-supported work here can bring your score up to 100%.
:::

### 1) Expected Value After 1 Flip

TODO: Explain whether the expected value of your account balance after one flip is >, =, or < $30,000. What is the gain in expected value as a percentage of your buy-in? Does this simple analysis suggest you should buy-in to the game?

```{python}
#| label: q1-expected-value-py
#| echo: true

# TODO: Compute EV after one flip in Python
# - Show calculation and brief explanation

```

### 2) Single Simulation Over Time (Narrative + Plot)

Briefly narrate and visualize what happens to your account balance over the course of one run. Are you happy with the outcome? Why? or Why not?  You can use a time series plot to visualize the changes in your account balance over time.

```{python}
#| label: q2-single-sim-py
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Single simulation path of account balance"

# TODO: Simulate one path from $30,000 over N periods
# - Make a matplotlib (OO) time-series
# - Set seed for reproducibility

```

### 3) 100 Simulations: Distribution of Final Balances

TODO: Visually and narratively describe the distribution of your account balance after running the 100 simulations. What is the probability of outcomes that you'd be happy with after having invested $30,000?

```{python}
#| label: q3-dist-100-py
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of final balances across 100 simulations"

# TODO: Run 100 simulations and plot histogram of final balances
# - Add vertical line at $30,000
# - Compute mean, median, and P(final > $30,000)

```

### 4) Probability Balance > $30,000 at Age 75 (Original Game)

TODO: Report the probability estimate and interpret its practical meaning.

```{python}
#| label: q4-prob-original-py
#| echo: true

# TODO: Using the 100 simulations above, estimate P(final > 30000)
# - Print numeric result with 3 decimals

```

### 5) Modified Strategy (Bet Exactly 50% Each Round)

Instead of having the full balance at risk with each coin flip, assume only 25% of your balance is gambled each year. Compare this to the original game. Which is riskier? Which has better upside?

```{python}
#| label: q5-modified-50pct-py
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Modified strategy distribution (bet 50% each round)"

# TODO: Implement the modified game
# - Run 100 simulations; plot distribution of final balances
# - Estimate P(final > 30000) and compare to original
# - visually compare the outcome distributions of the original and modified strategies

```

### 6) Briefly Explain Your Findings From The Previous Step in Light of A Concept Known as the "Kelly Criterion"
 
What is the Kelly Criterion and how does it relate to the modified strategy?


## Professional Presentation (From Grading TLDR)

- **Clear narrative:** tell the story succinctly (aim for a 1–5 minute read)
- **Focus on insights:** risk profiles, counter-intuitive results, practical implications
- **Professional style:** concise writing, clean visuals, hide code where appropriate (`echo: false`)
- **Human interpretation:** explain what results mean for real decisions

## Submission Checklist ✅

- [ ] Quarto document written with narrative and results
- [ ] Rendered to HTML successfully
- [ ] Repository `simulationChallenge` created on GitHub
- [ ] HTML committed and pushed
- [ ] GitHub Pages enabled (Deploy from a branch → main → /(root))
- [ ] Site accessible at `https://[your-username].github.io/simulationChallenge/`

## Tips

- Set random seeds for reproducibility
- Use object-oriented plotting with `matplotlib`
- Keep figures readable and labeled; prefer professional styling
- Commit early and often; render locally before pushing
